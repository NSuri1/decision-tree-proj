# Data Mining Basic Decision Tree

Classification is a form of data analysis where a model or classifier is constructed to predict class labels or types. Data classification is a two-phase process, 1) a learning phase in which the classifier is built and 2) a classifying phase where the determination of the class type of given data is performed. With this project, We were able to address problems in the two phases of classification, by implementing a basic algorithm to construct a classifier and by determining the class labels of given data tuples.

## Getting Started

1.) Download, or clone, the project.
2.) Open in Java IDE of your choice. (Or skip these steps and compile, then run through the command line)
3.) Open up src/Main.java and run the main method

## Running the tests

There will be tests... one day (I will get around to this)
